## Brief
The brief for this project was to create a CRUD application with "utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training."

#### Requirements
Along with the previous brief, the minimum requirements to achieve MVP (Minimum Viable Product) as as follows:
- A Jira board with full expansion on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project.
- Clear Documentation from a design phase describing the architecture you will use for your project.
- A detailed Risk Assessment created at the beginning of your project.
- A relational database used to store data persistently for the project.
- A functional application created in the OOP language, following best practices and design principles, that you have covered during training, this application needs to meet the - requirements set on your Kanban Board
- The application must have a functioning front-end website and integrated API.
- Fully designed test suites for the application you are creating, as well as automated tests for validation of the application.
- You must meet an acceptable level of test coverage in your backend and provide consistent reports and evidence that you have done so.
- Code fully integrated into a Version Control System

#### Solution
My solution to this objective was to create a to do List which allows users to: 

- CREATE a task so users can see what tasks have to be done
- READ all tasks to be completed
- UPDATE any tasks if changes are needed to be made
- DELETE tasks if the user choses to
