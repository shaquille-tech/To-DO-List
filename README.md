## Brief
The brief for this project was to create a CRUD application with the utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.

### Requirements
The minimum requirements to achieve MVP (Minimum Viable Product) as as follows:

- A Jira board with full expansion on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project.
- Clear Documentation from a design phase describing the architecture you will use for your project.
- A detailed Risk Assessment created at the beginning of your project.
- A relational database used to store data persistently for the project.
- A functional application created in the OOP language, following best practices and design principles, that you have covered during training, this application needs to meet the requirements set on your Kanban Board.
- The application must have a functioning front-end website and integrated API.
Fully designed test suites for the application you are creating, as well as automated tests for validation of the application.
- You must meet an acceptable level of test coverage in your backend and provide consistent reports and evidence that you have done so.
Code fully integrated into a Version Control System.

### Solution
My solution to this requirements was to create a To do List which allows users to :

- CREATE tasks for them to do in there own time.
- READ tasks to be completed
- UPDATE tasks 
- DELETE tasks

## Jira Board
My plan involved me using the scrum method to carry out the project, this would allow me to keep track of what I needed to do and what tasks have been completed. 
This method additionally aided me in trying to meet the MVP.

## Entity Relationship Diagram
Due to time constaraints, I went down a more simplistic route and made one table in the database,
which has all the necessary data for the to do list.
